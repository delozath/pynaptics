# pynaptics
A collection of lightweight Python scripts|snippets that can solve several atomic tasks such as, APIs connection and preprocessing data, etc. pynaptics contains utilities that support, but donâ€™t belong to my core research projects. Fast, OOP, modular, and just smart enough to keep things firing.
