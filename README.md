# pynaptics
A collection of lightweight Python scripts|snippets that can solve several atomic tasks such as, APIs connection and preprocessing data, etc. pynaptics contains utilities that support, but donâ€™t belong to my core research projects in machine learning, embedded AI, and medical applications. Fast, OOP, modular, and just smart enough to keep things firing.


## ðŸ§  Purpose

`pynaptics` serves as a flexible workspace for utility scripts that enable and accelerate my development workflow.  

Use cases include:

- Data preprocessing pipelines
- API clients (e.g., PubMed, ISBN lookup)
<!-- 
- Batch file handling and automation
- Metadata extraction
- Rapid prototyping for peripheral systems -->

- [NLP for Spanish Sentences](#natural-language-processing-sentence-preprocessing-in-mexican-spanish)
- [Latex generated PDF to plain text](#latex-generated-pdf-to-plain-text)

## ISBN Metadata Retriever

A lightweight tool to enrich lists of ISBNs with metadata by querying the Google Books API. Input is read from a CSV file, and the results are exported in CSV format.

[ðŸ”— repository link](./src/isbn_metadata/)

### ðŸ“š What It Does

- Loads a list of ISBNs from `data/libros.csv`
- Cleans and normalizes each ISBN (e.g., removes hyphens)
- Queries Google Books API for metadata:
  - Title
  - Authors
  - Publisher
  - Published Date
- Outputs the results to `data/output.csv`

## BibLaTeX Checker

A lightweight tool to clean, normalize, and convert BibLaTeX files into JSON and back, extracting abstracts into a CSV.

[ðŸ”— repository link](./src/biblatex_checker)

### ðŸ“š What It Does

* **Loads** a `.bib` file from the `data/` folder
* **Normalizes** BibLaTeX entry keys (replaces special characters with ASCII equivalents)
* **Converts** the cleaned BibLaTeX content into CSLâ€‘JSON using `pypandoc`
* **Deduplicates** authors and extracts abstracts into a DataFrame
* **Exports**

  * `data/output.bib` 
  * `data/abstracts.csv`

## Natural Language Processing: Sentence Preprocessing in Mexican Spanish
Provides tools to perform a preprocessing pipeline suitable for Natural Language Processing: tokenize, lemmanize, also to remove stopwords, accents and puctuation signs for Mexican Spanish senteces.

[ðŸ”— repository link](./src/nlp_preprocessing)

### ðŸ“š What It Does

* **Loads** `SpaCy` models: CPU and GPU based
* **Normalizes** Lower case, remove accents and stopwords, preserving negative words
* **Processing** Extract lemmas
* **Display** Show results in CLI
