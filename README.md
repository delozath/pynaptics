# pynaptics
A collection of lightweight Python scripts|snippets that can solve several atomic tasks such as, APIs connection and preprocessing data, etc. pynaptics contains utilities that support, but donâ€™t belong to my core research projects in machine learning, embedded AI, and medical applications. Fast, OOP, modular, and just smart enough to keep things firing.

## ðŸ§  Purpose

`pynaptics` serves as a flexible workspace for utility scripts that enable and accelerate my development workflow.  

Use cases include:

- Data preprocessing pipelines
- API clients (e.g., PubMed, ISBN lookup)

# - Batch file handling and automation

# - Metadata extraction

# - Rapid prototyping for peripheral systems
