We assess medical doctors’ ethical stance in situations that arise in adopting an AI-enabled Clinical Decision Support System (AI-CDSS) for antibiotic prescribing decision support in a healthcare institution in Singapore. Methods We conducted in-depth interviews with 30 doctors of varying medical specialties and designations between October 2022 and January 2023. Our interview guide was anchored on the four pillars of medical ethics. We used clinical vignettes with the following hypothetical scenarios: (1) Using an antibiotic AI-enabled CDSS’s recommendations for a tourist, (2) Uncertainty about the AI-CDSS’s recommendation of a narrow-spectrum antibiotic vs. concerns about antimicrobial resistance, (3) Patient refusing the “best treatment” recommended by the AI-CDSS, (4) Data breach. Results More than half of the participants only realized that the AI-enabled CDSS could have misrepresented non-local populations after being probed to think about the AI-CDSS’s data source. Regarding prescribing a broad- or narrow-spectrum antibiotic, most participants preferred to exercise their clinical judgment over the AI-enabled CDSS’s recommendations in their patients’ best interest. Two-thirds of participants prioritized beneficence over patient autonomy by convincing patients who refused the best practice treatment to accept it. Many were unaware of the implications of data breaches.

Disparities in access, quality, and health outcomes are exacerbated by socioeconomic, geographic, and systemic barriers. This paper proposes a conceptual model for addressing healthcare inequality through the implementation of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Decision Support Systems (DSS). The model integrates advanced data analytics, machine learning algorithms, and real-time health information to support clinical and policy decisions aimed at reducing disparities in healthcare delivery. The conceptual model operates on three core pillars: data integration, predictive analytics, and equitable decision-making. First, the model aggregates data from diverse sources—including electronic health records (EHRs), social determinants of health, and population health databases—to build a comprehensive profile of healthcare needs in various communities. Second, AI-driven predictive analytics are employed to identify at-risk populations, forecast disease trends, and allocate resources efficiently. Finally, the system provides tailored decision support for healthcare providers and policymakers, ensuring that interventions are responsive to the specific needs of disadvantaged groups. A key feature of the model is its emphasis on explainable AI (XAI), which ensures transparency, accountability, and trust in AI-generated recommendations. The model also incorporates fairness-aware algorithms to mitigate bias in data and decision-making, promoting inclusivity and ethical use of technology. Case simulations demonstrate how the system can optimize screening programs, prioritize high-risk patients, and guide equitable health policy formulation. This paper underscores the transformative potential of AI-based DSS in reducing healthcare inequality by enabling data-driven, context-sensitive, and inclusive health interventions.

10.1002/widm.1312,": Explainable artificial intelligence (AI) is attracting much interest in medicine. Technically, the problem of explainability is as old as AI itself and classic AI represented comprehensible retraceable approaches. However, their weakness was in dealing with uncertainties of the real world. Through the introduction of probabilistic learning, applications became increasingly successful, but increasingly opaque. Explainable AI deals with the implementation of transparency and traceability of statistical black-box machine learning methods, particularly deep learning (DL). We argue that there is a need to go beyond explainable AI. To reach a level of explainable medicine we need causability. In the same way that usability encompasses measurements for the quality of use, causability encompasses measurements for the quality of explanations. In this article, we provide some necessary definitions to discriminate between explainability and causability as well as a use-case of DL interpretation and of human explanation in histopathology.

Most studies were conducted outside of the United States, were published in nonobstetric journals, and focused on risk prediction. Study population sizes ranged widely from 10 to 953,909, and model performance abilities also varied widely. Evidence quality was assessed by the description of model construction, predictive accuracy, and whether validation had been performed. Most studies had patient groups differing considerably from U.S. populations, rendering their generalizability to U.S. patients uncertain. Artificial intelligence ultrasound applications focused on imaging issues are those most likely to influence current obstetric care. Other promising AI models include early risk screening for spontaneous preterm birth, preeclampsia, and gestational diabetes mellitus. The rate at which AI studies are being performed virtually guarantees that numerous applications will eventually be introduced into future U.S. obstetric practice. Very few of the models have been deployed in obstetric practice, and more high-quality studies are needed with high predictive accuracy and generalizability. Assuming these conditions are met, there will be an urgent need to educate medical students, postgraduate trainees and practicing physicians to understand how to effectively and safely implement this technology.",Devoe2025,"Devoe, Lawrence D."

10.1038/nature21056,"An artificial intelligence trained to classify images of skin lesions as benign lesions or malignant skin cancers achieves the accuracy of board-certified dermatologists. Andre Esteva et al. used 129,450 clinical images of skin disease to train a deep convolutional neural network to classify skin lesions. The result is an algorithm that can classify lesions from photographic images similar to those taken with a mobile phone. The accuracy of the system in detecting malignant melanomas and carcinomas matched that of trained dermatologists. The authors suggest that the technique could be used outside the clinic as a visual screen for cancer. Skin cancer, the most common human malignancy1,2,3, is primarily diagnosed visually, beginning with an initial clinical screening and followed potentially by dermoscopic analysis, a biopsy and histopathological examination. Automated classification of skin lesions using images is a challenging task owing to the fine-grained variability in the appearance of skin lesions. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)4,5 show potential for general and highly variable tasks across many fine-grained object categories6,7,8,9,10,11. Here we demonstrate classification of skin lesions using a single CNN, trained end-to-end from images directly, using only pixels and disease labels as inputs. We train a CNN using a dataset of 129,450 clinical images—two orders of magnitude larger than previous datasets12—consisting of 2,032 different diseases. We test its performance against 21 board-certified dermatologists on biopsy-proven clinical images with two critical binary classification use cases: keratinocyte carcinomas versus benign seborrheic keratoses; and malignant melanomas versus benign nevi. The first case represents the identification of the most common cancers, the second represents the identification of the deadliest skin cancer. The CNN achieves performance on par with all tested experts across both tasks, demonstrating an artificial intelligence capable of classifying skin cancer with a level of competence comparable to dermatologists. Outfitted with deep neural networks, mobile devices can potentially extend the reach of dermatologists outside of the clinic.

A turning point in machine learning occurred in the 2010s as a result of (1) the multiple technical improvements that machine learning has been accumulating over several decades, (2) the exponential increase in computing power, and (3) the wide availability of very large databases with millions of observations and thousands of variables. Machine learning is starting to be successfully applied to several areas of medicine, including predictive analytics, decision support, natural language processing of free‐text notes, and automatic interpretation of electrophysiological recordings. Among all the applications of machine learning in medicine, deep learning for computer vision is the one that has enjoyed the greatest success. The emphasis of this review is the application of convolutional neural networks for image classification and for image segmentation in neuroimaging. Machine learning and deep learning are increasingly integrated into the clinical workflow and applied in neuroimaging interpretation. Natural language processing is likely to gain increasing importance in medicine in the near future. Complex decision‐making that mimics human thinking with reinforcement learning is still far away on the horizon.",Fernandez2023,"Fernández, Iván Sánchez"
10.1016/s2589-7500(19)30123-2,"Summary Background Deep learning offers considerable promise for medical diagnostics. We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of deep learning algorithms versus health-care professionals in classifying diseases using medical imaging. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Ovid-MEDLINE, Embase, Science Citation Index, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index for studies published from Jan 1, 2012, to June 6, 2019. Studies comparing the diagnostic performance of deep learning models and health-care professionals based on medical imaging, for any disease, were included. We excluded studies that used medical waveform data graphics material or investigated the accuracy of image segmentation rather than disease classification. We extracted binary diagnostic accuracy data and constructed contingency tables to derive the outcomes of interest: sensitivity and specificity. Studies undertaking an out-of-sample external validation were included in a meta-analysis, using a unified hierarchical model. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42018091176. Findings Our search identified 31587 studies, of which 82 (describing 147 patient cohorts) were included. 69 studies provided enough data to construct contingency tables, enabling calculation of test accuracy, with sensitivity ranging from 9·7",Liu2019,"Liu, Xiaoxuan"

An increasing number of predictive tools have been developed with data sourced from electronic health records, diagnostic imaging and digital devices. In this review, we explore the latest tools of machine learning, the algorithms to establish prediction models and the challenges to assess fetal well-being, predict and diagnose obstetric diseases such as gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia, preterm birth and fetal growth restriction. We discuss the rapid growth of machine learning approaches and intelligent tools for automated diagnostic imaging of fetal anomalies and to asses fetoplacental and cervix function using ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. In prenatal diagnosis, we discuss intelligent tools for magnetic resonance imaging sequencing of the fetus, placenta and cervix to reduce the risk of preterm birth. Finally, the use of machine learning to improve safety standards in intrapartum care and early detection of complications will be discussed. The demand for technologies to enhance diagnosis and treatment in obstetrics and maternity should improve frameworks for patient safety and enhance clinical practice.",Arain2023,"Arain, Zara"
10.1016/j.diii.2018.08.001,"Abstract Purpose To evaluate the feasibility and reproducibility of artificial intelligence software (Smartplanes®) to automatically identify the transthalamic plane from 3D ultrasound volumes and to measure the biparietal diameter (BPD) and head circumference (HC) in fetus. Material and methods Thirty fetuses were evaluated at 17–30 weeks’ gestation. For each fetus two three-dimensional (3D) volumes of the fetal head along with one conventional two-dimensional (2D) image of the transthalamic plane were prospectively acquired. The Smartplanes® software identified the transthalamic plane from the 3D volumes and performed BPD and HC measurements automatically (3D auto). Two experienced sonographers also measured BPD and HC from 2D images and from the 3D volumes. Measurements were compared using Bland-Altman plots. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to evaluate intra- and interobserver reproducibility. Results For each series of measurements, intra- and interobserver reproducibility rates were high with ICC values>0.98. The 95",Grandjean2018,"Grandjean, G."
10.1016/j.fertnstert.2020.09.157,"Embryo evaluation and selection embody the aggregate manifestation of the entire invitro fertilization (IVF) process. It aims to choose the “best” embryos from the larger cohort of fertilized oocytes, the majority of which will be determined to be not viable either as a result of abnormal development or due to chromosomal imbalances. Indeed, it is generally acknowledged that even after embryo selection based on morphology, time-lapse microscopic photography, or embryo biopsy with preimplantation genetic testing, implantation rates in the human are difficult to predict. Our pursuit of enhancing embryo evaluation and selection, as well as increasing live birth rates, will require the adoption of novel technologies. Recently, several artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods have emerged as objective, standardized, and efficient tools for evaluating human embryos. Moreover, AI-based methods can be implemented for other clinical aspects of IVF, such as assessing patient reproductive potential and individualizing gonadotropin stimulation protocols. As AI has the capability to analyze “big” data, the ultimate goal will be to apply AI tools to the analysis of all embryological, clinical, and genetic data in an effort to provide patient-tailored treatments. In this chapter, we present an overview of existing AI technologies in reproductive medicine and envision their potential future applications in the field.",Zaninovic2020,"Zaninović, Nikica"
10.1371/journal.pone.0219388,"Introduction: Ovarian tumors are the most common diagnostic challenge for gynecologists and ultrasound examination has become the main technique for assessment of ovarian pathology and for preoperative distinction between malignant and benign ovarian tumors. However, ultrasonography is highly examiner-dependent and there may be an important variability between two different specialists when examining the same case. The objective of this work is the evaluation of different well-known Machine Learning (ML) systems to perform the automatic categorization of ovarian tumors from ultrasound images. Methods: We have used a real patient database whose input features have been extracted from 348 images, from the IOTA tumor images database, holding together with the class labels of the images. For each patient case and ultrasound image, its input features have been previously extracted using Fourier descriptors computed on the Region Of Interest (ROI). Then, four ML techniques are considered for performing the classification stage: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Linear Discriminant (LD), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Results: According to our obtained results, the KNN classifier provides inaccurate predictions (less than 60",Martinez-Mas2019,"Martínez-Más, José"

This algorithm works by using a feed-forward neural network to identify patterns in the data that represent the baby’s movements. It then uses back propagation to adjust the weights of the neural network to accurately predict the future movements. The ID3 algorithm can also be used to predict baby movement during pregnancy. This algorithm works by using a decision tree to identify patterns in the data that represent the baby’s movements. It then uses the ID3 algorithm to identify the best decision at each node and to create a decision tree that can accurately predict the future movements. AI and machine learning can be used to monitor a fetus’s vital signs in a number of ways. Back propagation and ID3 algorithms were used to detect any abnormality in the heartbeat, breathing patterns, or other physiological changes and used to track fetal movements, such as kicks and hiccups, as well as any changes in fetal position. Finally, AI and machine learning can be used to predict when a baby is ready to be born.",Alikkal2023,"Alikkal, Vinish"
10.21037/atm.2020.03.63,": Interest in the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to medicine is growing fast and wide because of their ability to endow decision support systems with so-called artificial intelligence, particularly in those medical disciplines that extensively rely on digital imaging. Nonetheless, achieving a pragmatic and ecological validation of medical AI systems in real-world settings is difficult, even when these systems exhibit very high accuracy in laboratory settings. This difficulty has been called the ""last mile of implementation."" In this review of the concept, we claim that this metaphorical mile presents two chasms: the hiatus of human trust and the hiatus of machine experience. The former hiatus encompasses all that can hinder the concrete use of AI at the point of care, including availability and usability issues, but also the contradictory phenomena of cognitive ergonomics, such as automation bias (overreliance on technology) and prejudice against the machine (clearly the opposite). The latter hiatus, on the other hand, relates to the production and availability of a sufficient amount of reliable and accurate clinical data that is suitable to be the ""experience"" with which a machine can be trained. In briefly reviewing the existing literature, we focus on this latter hiatus of the last mile, as it has been largely neglected by both ML developers and doctors. In doing so, we argue that efforts to cross this chasm require data governance practices and a focus on data work, including the practices of data awareness and data hygiene. To address the challenge of bridging the chasms in the last mile of medical AI implementation, we discuss the six main socio-technical challenges that must be overcome in order to build robust bridges and deploy potentially effective AI in real-world clinical settings.",Cabitza2020,"Cabitza, Federico"
10.1038/s41591-021-01359-w,"Machine learning (ML) holds great promise for impacting healthcare delivery; however, to date most methods are tested in ’simulated’ environments that cannot recapitulate factors influencing real-world clinical practice. We prospectively deployed and evaluated a random forest algorithm for therapeutic curative-intent radiation therapy (RT) treatment planning for prostate cancer in a blinded, head-to-head study with full integration into the clinical workflow. ML- and human-generated RT treatment plans were directly compared in a retrospective simulation with retesting (n=50) and a prospective clinical deployment (n=50) phase. Consistently throughout the study phases, treating physicians assessed ML- and human-generated RT treatment plans in a blinded manner following a priori defined standardized criteria and peer review processes, with the selected RT plan in the prospective phase delivered for patient treatment.

10.1016/j.medj.2021.04.006,"Summary Machine learning is increasingly integrated into clinical practice, with applications ranging from pre-clinical data processing, bedside diagnosis assistance, patient stratification, treatment decision making, and early warning as part of primary and secondary prevention. However, a multitude of technological, medical, and ethical considerations are critical in machine-learning utilization, including the necessity for careful validation of machine-learning-based technologies in real-life contexts, unbiased evaluation of benefits and risks, and avoidance of technological over-dependence and associated loss of clinical, ethical, and social-related decision-making capacities. Other challenges include the need for careful benchmarking and external validations, dissemination of end-user knowledge from computational experts to field users, and responsible code and data sharing, enabling transparent assessment of pipelines. In this review, we highlight key promises and achievements in integration of machine-learning platforms into clinical medicine while highlighting limitations, pitfalls, and challenges toward enhanced integration of learning systems into the medical realm.",Adlung2021,"Adlung, Lorenz"

However, problems such as high fetal mobility, excessive maternal abdominal wall thickness, and inter-observer variability limit the development of traditional ultrasound in clinical applications. The combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and obstetric ultrasound may help optimize fetal ultrasound examination by shortening the examination time, reducing the physician’s workload, and improving diagnostic accuracy. AI has been successfully applied to automatic fetal ultrasound standard plane detection, biometric parameter measurement, and disease diagnosis to facilitate conventional imaging approaches.

10.18137/cardiometry.2023.27.111117,"The article analyzes the use of digital methods and artificial intelligence capabilities for diagnostics in the field of obstetrics and gynecology. The author notes that digital methods and artificial intelligence (AI) have a high potential for the diagnosis of gynecological diseases, since it can analyze medical images and other medical data with great accuracy and speed. For example, AI can help in the diagnosis of cervical cancer by identifying anomalies in digital images and screening tests. The use of AI can also help in the recognition of other gynecological diseases, such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, polyps, etc. In addition, AI can help improve the efficiency and accuracy of diagnostics, as well as reduce the time required to process medical data. This can be especially important in cases where diagnosis needs to be done quickly in order to start treatment as early as possible. However, it should be noted that AI cannot completely replace the experience and expertise of doctors. Still, it can help doctors make more accurate diagnoses and develop more effective treatment strategies.",Safiullina2023,"Safiullina, Elena"
10.3390/jcm12216833,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has gained prominence in medical imaging, particularly in obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN), where ultrasound (US) is the preferred method. It is considered cost effective and easily accessible but is time consuming and hindered by the need for specialized training. To overcome these limitations, AI models have been proposed for automated plane acquisition, anatomical measurements, and pathology detection. This study aims to overview recent literature on AI applications in OB/GYN US imaging, highlighting their benefits and limitations. For the methodology, a systematic literature search was performed in the PubMed and Cochrane Library databases. Matching abstracts were screened based on the PICOS (Participants, Intervention or Exposure, Comparison, Outcome, Study type) scheme. Articles with full text copies were distributed to the sections of OB/GYN and their research topics. As a result, this review includes 189 articles published from 1994 to 2023. Among these, 148 focus on obstetrics and 41 on gynecology. AI-assisted US applications span fetal biometry, echocardiography, or neurosonography, as well as the identification of adnexal and breast masses, and assessment of the endometrium and pelvic floor. To conclude, the applications for AI-assisted US in OB/GYN are abundant, especially in the subspecialty of obstetrics. However, while most studies focus on common application fields such as fetal biometry, this review outlines emerging and still experimental fields to promote further research.",Jost2023,"Jost, Elena"
